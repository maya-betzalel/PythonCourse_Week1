# Python Course – Week 1 Project

This repository contains my Week 1 assignment for the Python course.

The original version of the project included manually entered data.  
In the updated version, the data is generated using appropriate statistical distributions:

- `gender` is sampled from a categorical distribution ("m", "f")
- `age` is sampled from a uniform range (18–40)
- `depression` is sampled using a binomial distribution (0/1)

The code creates a data frame and saves it as a CSV file.
